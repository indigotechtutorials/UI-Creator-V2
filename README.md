# UI Creator v2

This is an app to help you create a UI library for your next website.

### Tech used

Built using Ruby on Rails. without any third party CSS library only plain css.

##### Why v2?

v2 because I first started creating this same app but using TailwindCSS and decided to do it again using vanilla css and see what I can create.


##### Currently a work in progress

This is definitely still a work in progress but I can't wait to share this app off once its ready!

Here is current progress. We have one button built! Messing around with HSL colors which is new for adjusting hues and such based off variable of CSS. Meaning instead palletes for any color. Interesting
